🎓 Student Placement Prediction Using Machine Learning

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether a student will get placed based on academic and aptitude indicators such as CGPA and IQ. This system helps students and institutions take proactive career decisions using data-driven insights.

📌 Project Overview

Student placement is a major concern in today’s competitive job market. This project uses supervised machine learning classification algorithms to analyze student performance data and predict placement outcomes.

A user-friendly Flask web application allows users to enter CGPA and IQ values and instantly receive placement predictions.
